                                In today's society, anxiety and depression are becoming increasingly troublesome mental
                                health disorders, and they appear to be especially severe in industrialized and
                                developing nations. Depression is the most severe form of sadness, and it is well
                                acknowledged as a significant role in lowering people's effectiveness and as the leading
                                cause of suicide. Suicidal thoughts and even suicide attempts can occur when serious
                                mental diseases go untreated. Cyberstalking and cyberbullying are kinds of harassment
                                that occur over the internet and directly impair a person's mental health. The
                                consequences may be serious and harmful, since individuals who engage in social cruelty
                                are more likely to be involved in gossip and even mental injury. There is a correlation
                                between cyberbullying and suicide, according to research. Victims who are
                                continually exposed to hurtful words or events may become sad and despondent, and in the
                                worst-case scenario, they commit suicide.<br><br> Most people like this reach out to
                                online
                                social media platforms to express their concerns just to get some help or to share their
                                feelings. When people openly discuss their feelings on social media without worrying
                                about the social stigma, it can be assumed that it represents their true feelings.
                                Usually, there are many posts with sensitive content in such forums, indicating that the
                                user is at risk of suicide and self-harm. In that theory, many researchers are now
                                focusing on developing systems that can automatically identify people at risk for
                                suicide by conducting an accurate study of these data. The urgency of these systems can
                                be seen in focus on contemporary society.<br><br>

                                Hence, the major purpose of the text analyzing part of our research study is to look at
                                individuals' social media posts to see if they have any depressive thoughts. Machine
                                learning-based classification approaches and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
                                techniques used to social media posts for training the data and then evaluate efficiency
                                for early detection of suicide ideation. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier best
                                reveals the combined features' power and efficacy (LIWC + LDA + bigram). Furthermore,
                                this provides the best results for the identification of depression, with 91% of
                                accuracy along with 0.93 F1 scores. <br><br>

                                To assess and compare it to other classification models, a LSTM, GRU model has been
                                used. The best applicability classification results can be obtained using a combination
                                of word embedding methods and neural network architecture according to our research.
                                Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that deep learning architectures may be used to
                                develop an effective model for assessing suicide risk in a variety of text
                                categorization tasks.Images with text (texted images) contains valuable information
                                same as content-based images (non-texted images). There are very few research
                                regards the detecting suicide related images but contain very important information
                                although they are not directly similar. Images on webs, social media, and in databases
                                are increasing in every single minute. Therefore, it is very valuable to implement
                                effective techniques to filter and manage these by the content of multimedia materials

                                There is text detection research in natural scene images robotically which named
                                “USTB_TexStar”. Nowadays there are many systems to identify text in day today life such
                                as traffic warning and advertisement board text. When compared to other image features,
                                text embedded in photos can directly expose the picture content in a given point of view
                                without requiring extensive processing. They used the MSER-based scenario text detection
                                method in this case. Initially, MSER's pruning algorithm was utilized to recognize most
                                characters even when the image was of poor quality, and then a self-training distance
                                metric learning algorithm was presented to simultaneously find distance weights and
                                clustering threshold. Then they built a strong scene text detection system by combining
                                the above new strategies and creating a more powerful text classifier. There has
                                been a few research on the use of image-based social media as intervention methods for
                                suicide-related imagery, but the results were mostly exploratory.<br><br>

                                One of other research about non suicidal self-injuries but not exactly about suicide
                                related images using Instagram (NSSI), They used a dataset with 30,000 labeled instances
                                of NSSI to train the ACoL model and compared the output results with two pre-trained
                                models which are VGG16 and ResNet50. The ACoL reached classification accuracy of 94% and
                                outperformed other modern Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. The ACoL
                                outperformed other recent CNN models with a classification accuracy of 94%. They created
                                a content crawler to collect data that scans Instagram for images, texts, and videos
                                using hashtags on a regular basis and saves them to cloud storage. Using an Instagram
                                crawler, they gathered over 1.45 million NSSI-related posts and downloaded over 1.7
                                million photos. After they classified those images into six 3 categories by extracting
                                the hashtags associated with NSSI-related posts. To successfully recognize NSSI photos,
                                a deep learning-based binary image classifier was utilized for image classification. <br><br>

                                When considering the image data generation because there are no sufficient image
                                datasets for this suicide related image scenario, Augmentation through simple image
                                alteration is the naivest way of data generation. To create new data, this method
                                utilizes original images using image translation, noise addition, and rotation. These
                                approaches are also included in our model to boost robustness and perform
                                better. <br><br>

                                The purpose of the suicide text analysis research component is to enhance the
                                performance of text classification and language modeling system for detecting suicide
                                ideation in several social medias with the use of a machine learning classifier. This
                                section contains a detailed discussion of methods that employ a number of NLP and text
                                classification techniques. Convolutional and single recurrent neural networks are used
                                as vectors to encode a whole
                                sequence, on the other hand, tend to miss key information sequences.
                                Consequently, several experiments were done to establish a hybrid framework for coherent
                                combinations of CNNs and RNNs to use merits of both.
                                Specifically, the text analyzing research component contributes in three ways:
                                N-gram analysis: Use n-gram analysis to find out suicidal ideation and reduced social
                                engagements are widely discussed in suicide-related forums, as well as to see if the
                                transition from self-focused attention to social ideation is linked to manifestations of
                                hopelessness, heightened self-focused attention, frustration, , loneliness, or anxiety.
                                Analysis of classical features: Using LSTM and GRU analyze the performance of the bag of
                                words, TF-IDF, and statistical features over the word embedding.
                                Comparative evaluation: We studied the function of the LSTM and GRU deep neural networks
                                like the recommended model for identifying suicide ideation tasks, to develop the
                                state-of-the-art method.
                                The proposed Framework includes feature extraction, data pre-processing and the uses of
                                natural language processing (NLP) approaches to encode words for use by classic machine
                                learning systems. Pre-processing is the practice of filtering text input to enhance the
                                validity of a recommended technique by removing extraneous information in order to
                                handle all the raw posts beforehand learning of word embedding. Before moving on to the
                                training phase of our research, we engage the Natural language toolkit (NLTK) to
                                pre-process the dataset.
                                Using LSTM and GRU neural network architecture to create a unified LSTM, GRU model for
                                classifying selected text data in order to identify the suicidal thoughts on social
                                media. Following that it creates a new GRU and LSTM model extract the attributes of the
                                input text phrases and increase the accuracy of classification.

                                Suicide-Related Image Detection
                                <br><br>


                                The key factor that had to be examined in the domain of suicide-related image
                                identification was user behavior recognition utilizing their uploaded images. This had
                                to be a novel way because there had never been a procedure that used a Generative
                                Adversarial Network (GAN) to identify a user who was depressed or attempting suicide.
                                Various research has concluded that a considerable amount of data is required for the
                                success of CNN-based learning algorithms. However, in practice, such a large dataset is
                                not always available. GAN is an unsupervised learning technique in machine
                                learning, and it was helpful because there was not a sufficient dataset. Developing a
                                GAN requires both discriminator and generator CNN models. The discriminator model is
                                used to determine if an image is real or not. The generator model is used to generate
                                new images that may have been generated from the original dataset. The model of
                                generator learns to generate new convincing suicide-related images and discriminator
                                model that tries to differentiate real suicide-related photos in the training dataset
                                with new images generated by the generator model.

                                <br><br>
                                <img src="assets/img/namin img1.png"> <br><br>

                                As the first step, we defined a discriminator model by inputting images of sample from
                                dataset and obtain a classification forecast as output to determine if the sample data
                                is real or not. The model of discriminator contains two convolutional layers, each with
                                filters of 64, a small kernel size of three, and a stride of two. The model uses an
                                activation function of sigmoid to determine if the input sample is real or fake, and it
                                has been trained to reduce the binary cross entropy loss function, which makes it ideal
                                for binary classification. Best practices were used in this discriminator, such as the
                                use of Dropout, the Adam version of stochastic gradient descent including learning rate
                                of 0.0002, momentum of 0.5, and the use of 'LeakyReLU' by instead 'ReLU.'
                                Furthermore, developed a generator which, responsible for generating new plausible, fake
                                suicide related images. Main focus of this generator model is to generate new plausible
                                fake samples against the discriminator model’s performance on fake images distinguish.
                                Meanwhile, training the generator model through logical GAN model, the purpose is to
                                convince the discriminator that the samples generated by the generator are real.
                                The discriminator model updated in batches, contains a set of real samples and another
                                set of produced samples. On training, an epoch is defined as a single run across the
                                entire training dataset. After defining the model, loaded the dataset, and trained the
                                discriminator.
                                After developed the GAN, it used in the social media post uploader component in the
                                social media application to detect suicide related images

                                <br><br>

                                Key logger <br><br>

                                A key logger was implemented to capture the keystrokes from the social media web
                                application. This key logger can capture all keystrokes entered by the user. Sensitive
                                information provided by users will not be stored in any of the databases because the key
                                logger was created solely for the purpose of identifying suicidal intent. Before being
                                sent to the suicide prediction model, all the keystrokes are pre-processed. Before being
                                fed to the suicide prediction model, pre-processed key logs are fed to a sentence
                                generation learning model. Google’s T5 model has been used for generating sentences.
                                This learning model predicts the possible sentences from the key logs which are fed to
                                it. Since the key logger captures all key logs, there may be times when the user deletes
                                messages and then retypes them, causing the key log records to be out of order. In the
                                recorded key logs, there may be a sequence of characters followed by a delete key or
                                backspace, spaces, and quotation marks. It would be a huge problem if such records were
                                introduced into the learning model without any pre-processing since they are useless.
                                Data pre-processing and Google's T5 model will be utilized to construct meaningful
                                phrases from the characters captured by keyboard logger in order to address that issue.
                                The produced phrases are then retrieved from the T5 model and fed into the NLP model
                                that predicts suicidal ideation. This NLP model will be trained on a huge dataset that
                                includes both suicidal and non-suicidal material.

                                Chatbot <br><br>

                                Throughout the overall system, the main objective is early detection of suicide and
                                suicidal behaviors by analyzing user data obtained from a social media-based web
                                application to provide psychological support for suicide prevention. The main
                                requirements for using the chatbot are the processes discussed below. As the main
                                requirement, the chatbot should automatically activate and initiate a conversation with
                                the user when the system detects the suicidal ideation of a user. The system identifies
                                a suicidal user based on the results from image and text analysis components. In this
                                way, we can refer to the table below to avoid the problem of at which time exactly the
                                chatbot triggers.

                                <br><br>
                                <img src="assets/img/rosy img1.png"><br><br>

                                Here the suicidal detection for each component at a respective time is indicated by the
                                number 1 and non-suicidal detection indicates by the number 0. Therefore, the chatbot
                                activates when one or both components indicate suicidal content.
                                Chatbot's message stream varies depending on the response of the identified user. It
                                should respond more accurately and should be able to connect to any user at any time of
                                the day. `The system displays positive posts via chatbot conversations. It will also
                                improve their mental health by improving their self-confidence and positive thinking. As
                                a last step, providing contact information to contact the relevant parties for
                                psychological support is the best solution for people with identified mental disorders.
                                To overcome all of these chatbot responses, the user inputs and responses query must be
                                well trained.
